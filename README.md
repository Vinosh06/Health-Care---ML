Problem statement:
Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally. It is therefore necessary to identify the causes and develop a system to predict heart attacks in an effective manner. The data below has the information about the factors that might have an impact on cardiovascular health. 

Task to be performed:
1.	Preliminary analysis:
- Perform preliminary data inspection and report the findings on the structure of the data, missing values, duplicates, etc.
-	Based on these findings, remove duplicates (if any) and treat missing values using an appropriate strategy

2.	Prepare a report about the data explaining the distribution of the disease and the related factors using the steps listed below:
-	Get a preliminary statistical summary of the data and explore the measures of central tendencies and spread of the data
-	Identify the data variables which are categorical and describe and explore these variables using the appropriate tools, such as count plot 
-	Study the occurrence of CVD across the Age category
-	Study the composition of all patients with respect to the Sex category
-	Study if one can detect heart attacks based on anomalies in the resting blood pressure (trestbps) of a patient
-	Describe the relationship between cholesterol levels and a target variable
-	State what relationship exists between peak exercising and the occurrence of a heart attack
-	Check if thalassemia is a major cause of CVD
-	List how the other factors determine the occurrence of CVD
-	Use a pair plot to understand the relationship between all the given variables

3.	Build a baseline model to predict the risk of a heart attack using a logistic regression and random forest and explore the results while using correlation analysis and logistic regression (leveraging standard error and p-values from statsmodels) for feature selection
